            <p>
                During my first year of study, I actively participated in the development of a wire bending machine as part of a course project.
                We employed a combination of tools to construct a 3D model for visualization purposes. Subsequently, we initiated hardware development and proceeded to complete the project iteratively in sprints. 
                Our team's efforts were recognized by the University, receiving a commendation for our work on the project.

            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p>
                In my third year, I spearheaded the development of a real-time predictive model utilizing machine learning to discern age, gender, and emotion. Our aim was to publish a comprehensive research paper outlining our discoveries and methodologies. To achieve this, we trained separate models for age, gender, and emotion. We employed the Haar Cascade tool to detect faces in images, which were subsequently validated using our platform.
